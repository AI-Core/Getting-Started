# Getting started

This repo is just to get you ready to move onto more interesting stuff.

It covers:
- Setting up your package manager (your package manager that allows you to use useful code that others have written)
- Setting up Python 3 (the latest version of the Python programming language)
- Setting up Jupyter Notebook
- Setting up PyTorch (our deep learning framework library)

This will be much easier if you're using Linux instead of Windows or MacOS.

You should move on once you can successfully run the final notebook. If you don't know what any of that means, or can't run the final notebook, then follow the steps below.

## 1. Setting up your package manager


## 2. Setting up Python 3

## 3. Setting up PyTorch

Go to [the PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and select the relevant options. This will give you a command. Copy it and run it in your terminal.

## Now open the final notebook by starting jupyter in your terminal

You now might want to check out:
- basic data science
- using git and github
- using the command line interface
