# Getting started

This repo is just to get you ready to move onto more interesting stuff.

It covers:
- Setting up pip 3 (your package manager that allows you to use useful code that others have written)
- setting up Python 3 (the latest version of the Python programming language)
- Setting up PyTorch (our deep learning framework library)

You should move on once you can successfully run the final notebook.
