# Getting started

This repo is just to get you ready to move onto more interesting stuff.

It covers:
- Setting up your package manager (your package manager that allows you to use useful code that others have written)
- Setting up Python 3 (the latest version of the Python programming language)
- Setting up PyTorch (our deep learning framework library)

This will be much easier if you're using Linux instead of Windows or MacOS.

You should move on once you can successfully run the final notebook. If you don't know what any of that means, or can't run the final notebook, then follow the steps below.
